    <h1>Definition: Browser Cache</h1>
    <p>
      A browser cache is a temporary storage area that holds the most recently downloaded webpages. When you go switch between multiple web pages, the cache lets you quickly switch back and forth without having to download it from the web everytime. Clearing your cookies resets the MailChimp form again because MailChimp will see no history and treat it as a new visitor thus displaying a new subscribe.
